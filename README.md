IT SUPPORT PROFESSIONAL:  HELP DESK AND DESKTOP SUPPORT

A successful professional career requires the ability to keep track of multiple persons, objects, and processes in space and time. It demands quick, responsible decision-making and a professional demeanor in a corporate environment.

I am a US citizen, live in the Portland area, and have no issues with drug / background / DMV checks. I hold CompTIA A+ certification and have reliable transportation, Oregon Class C license, current auto insurance, and a clean driving record. I'm an honorably discharged military veteran.

Skill set includes Active Directory, MS Exchange, ITSM (ServiceNow, HP Service Manager, Cherwell), remote desktop, and excellent customer service and administrative skills.

I enjoy challenging work in a fast-paced environment, and I'm not afraid of hard work and extra hours. There's a special satisfaction in getting a tough job done well.
