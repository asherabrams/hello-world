# hello-world

I am a US citizen, live in the Portland area, and have no issues with drug / background / DMV checks. I hold CompTIA A+ certification and have reliable transportation, Oregon Class C license, current auto insurance, and a clean driving record. I'm an honorably discharged military veteran.

Skill set includes Active Directory, MS Exchange, ITSM (ServiceNow, HP Service Manager, Cherwell), remote desktop, and excellent customer service and administrative skills.

I enjoy challenging work in a fast-paced environment, and I'm not afraid of hard work and extra hours. I am looking for full-time work in the IT field, specifically in help desk or desktop support.
