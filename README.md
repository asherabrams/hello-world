# hello-world

I am a US citizen, live in the Portland area, and have no issues with drug / background / DMV checks. I hold CompTIA A+ certification and have reliable transportation, Oregon Class C license, current auto insurance, and a clean driving record. I'm an honorably discharged military veteran.

I enjoy challenging work in a fast-paced environment, and I'm not afraid of hard work and extra hours. I am looking for full-time work in the IT field, specifically in help desk or desktop support.
